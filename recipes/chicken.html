<h4>These quick and easy pan-fried chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice</h4>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</ul>
<ul>cayenne pepper, or to taste</ul>
<ul>salt and ground pepper to taste</ul>
<ul>all-purpose flour for dredging</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons olive oil</ul>
<ul>1 tablespoon capers, drained</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup white wine</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup water</ul>
<ul>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p>
    Placace chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>
    Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>
    Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p>
    Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
<p>
    Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
<p>
    Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
<p>
    Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
